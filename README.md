# -Caesar-cipher
The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques. The method involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3:

Plaintext: THE QUICK BROWN FOX
Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU

Here, each letter in the plaintext is shifted three positions to the left in the alphabet to produce the ciphertext. When decoding, you simply shift the letters back by the same number of positions.

## Instructions: 
First to use the program, one must install the Python compiler. To do so, enter the site and follow the given steps: https://code.visualstudio.com/
Then to start the program you must give the: the word to encode or decode, the shift parameter, and specify that you want to encode or decode your word.
